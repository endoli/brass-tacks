# Annotations

Since in our system, everything is a thing, we have a good basis
for providing system-wide annotations of everything.  Anything
that has a persistent identity (a stable URI) can have annotations
made.

We will use the W3C Web Annotation work that is being done and
build upon that specification.

Annotations should be a great way of making notes that are attached
to a particular context. If you are debugging something, then you
can annotate your breakpoints, functions in the executable, or
almost anything else. Annotations can be used in a multi-user
context for sharing notes, asking and answering questions, or
performing reviews.

Having annotations built in at the ground level should be a very
exciting opportunity.
