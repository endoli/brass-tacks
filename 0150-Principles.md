# Principles

## Tangibility

Everything is tangible.

We'll see that everything is structured data.

We'll see how the command system works.

There's a lot of fallout from these things. One of them is that,
in this world, everything is tangible.

Everything is, well, a thing. It has an identity. It can be
interacted with via commands. Later, we'll see that everything
can have a representation within a user interface and that,
again, it can be interacted with via a command.

The scheduler that runs tasks either periodically (ala `cron`)
and at specific times (ala `at`) isn't just an abstract entity
somewhere. It is something that we can interact with, query,
command, inspect.

This should be true of everything within the system.

## Accessibility

## Direct Manipulation

## Visibility

Everything is visible.

Logging, tracing and performance monitoring metrics are built
into the system at every level.
