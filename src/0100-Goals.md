# Goals

## Unplanned Component Cooperation

With the use of structured data and schemas / ontologies, it
our intention that components be able to cooperate with each
other in ways that aren't planned in advance. Our descriptions
of some sample usages will illustrate this.

## Decision Fatigue

Reduce decision fatigue. Provide a reasonable set of widgets, styles
and functionality that make writing a tool more straightforward
than doing it in raw HTML.

Let the programmer focus on solving the problem that is actually
and immediately in front of them rather than spending time dealing
with setting up an entire stack of tools and frameworks.

## Ease of Development

Make writing a tool that has some graphical output as easy as
writing a text-based tool.

## Structured Information

Information has structure and meaning. We should maintain this
for as long as possible within the systems rather than throwing
it away when rendering output, etc.
