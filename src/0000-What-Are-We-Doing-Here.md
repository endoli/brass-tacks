# What Are We Doing Here?

Today, we live in a world dominated by applications. Data mostly
exists within silos, owned by individual applications. Exchanging
data between applications happens via raw sequences of bytes.

Further, data about things is encoded in application-specific
manners. In fact, for the most part, we don't really have the
concept of things that exist outside of our applications.

We have some questions that we're interested in investigating
here.

* Can we move from specialized data stores to having the
  data be at the center of everything?
* What if we make computing and our computing experience
  about "things" instead of raw data?
* Can we interact more directly with these "things" rather
  than applications themselves? Are we able to return to
  a model that is based upon direct manipulation by making
  our "things" more tangible?
* Can we model our interactions with these "things" in terms
  of "commands" which can be executed in a variety of ways
  from multiple input mechanisms, such as menus, buttons,
  toolbars, command lines, scripts, voice input, etc?

We can investigate these questions starting with some applications
and growing from there to larger systems.

These techniques can be applied to development and programming
tools, operating system shells (both command line and GUI),
windowing systems, and even things like educational materials
like the future of books.

## AI First?

There's talk of developing for AI first. We've previously
developed for "mobile first" and at some point soon there will
likely be talk (for some applications) of "VR first".

Multimode interfaces are very important to us. As we'll see,
we treat interaction with an application in a way that fully
supports using the application from multiple contexts or
interfaces.

## Substrate

We are supplying a new substrate for building software. This
allows for building individual applications as well as broader
concepts up to and including an alternative operating system
shell / UI.

This substrate provides the following key services:

* Structured Data
* Command Handling
* User Interface System

We will discuss each of these in depth in subsequent documents.
