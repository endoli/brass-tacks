# eBPF

eBPF is a VM for a small set of instructions that can run sandboxed
and resource limited code. The original BPF came from the BSD
Unix systems where it was used for packet filtering but in recent
times, it has been extended significantly by the Linux kernel where
it is used for executing code within the kernel for tracing,
performance monitoring and analysis, and other features.

We have need for being able to ship code from one process to
another without shipping arbitrary binary code. This is used
when we want to move a computation to be local to the data
that it works with to avoid the overhead of IPC or RPC.

Examples of this might be:

* You are extending a debugger and want to have some code
  execute very frequently in response to a breakpoint
  being hit. Having to have your code talk to the debug
  server over IPC and have network traffic on every
  breakpoint hit is not viable in terms of performance.
  Instead, you could ship a small program to the debug
  server for it to execute on every breakpoint hit.
* When quick UI feedback is needed and the response to the
  UI action doesn't require talking to the program presenting
  the UI, the response could happen from a small program that
  was shipped to the display server for this purpose. In
  the venerable NeWS windowing system in the 1980s, a client
  could send Postscript code to the window system for
  execution like this.
* ...

eBPF is fairly general, but has many limitations so that it
can be safe to execute in time-sensitive scenarios in a safe
manner.

LLVM 3.7 and later has a backend that can target eBPF, so
`clang` can compile C to eBPF bytecode.

The eBPF VM can be very small and is easy to implement. This is in
stark contrast to other technologies that might fill this role
such as WebAssembly.
