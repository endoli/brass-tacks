# Rust

Rust is the main implementation language for the
Endoli family of projects.

## Safety & performance

Rust is able to verify a number of safety properties at compile
time without introducing overhead at run time. This includes
eliminating data races and various sorts of memory corruption.

Rust doesn't have a garbage collector, instead relying upon
compile time checks that verify memory ownership.

## Wide platform support

Rust runs well on many platforms and has good community support
for expanding to additional platforms. It works on Windows, Linux,
Mac OS X, FreeBSD, Android and iOS. It runs on x86, x86_64 and
ARM platforms.

It also is able to run on bare metal hardware or directly on
a hypervisor. This means that some of the libraries and concepts
being implemented here may be useful in the construction of
a new operating system, not just for applications running on
current platforms.

## Native libraries

Rust builds native executables and libraries. This is useful
when looking at platform support as we saw above.

Additionally, a Rust library can provide a C compatible API so
that the Rust library can be invoked from other environments.
Rust has been used to write extensions for Node.js, Python, Ruby,
Java, and more. It can be called from C, C++, Objective C, and
Swift. Nearly everything has the ability to invoke a function
that has a C compatible API.

This means that even should we need to implement some portions
of our platform in a language other than Rust, the work that
we do in Rust is still usable and applicable, even if it
involves going through a foreign function interface (FFI).

## Developer ergonomics

Rust is a pleasure to use as a developer. Many decisions
and pain points present in other native development environments
are addressed in the default usage scenarios for Rust.

Rust is easily installed using `rustup.rs` which provides
a way to manage and run multiple versions of the compiler
as well as managing which platforms are supported as build
targets.

The `cargo` tool is great. It works, it doesn't cause
significant amounts of pain. It not only manages running
builds and tests, but also handles dependency Management
and automatic downloading and compilation of dependencies.

Rust has the `rustdoc` tool for generating documentation. This
also integrates with running the code present in documentation
comments as an additional set of tests.

This is a very different scenario than working with C or C++
where there is no standard agreement on how to manage
toolchains, dependencies, build configuration, documentation
generation, testing frameworks or much of anything else.

## Green field

Usually, people look to an existing language and hope to see a
wide range of available libraries that can handle pretty much
any imaginable task.  And sure, Rust has a lot of libraries
and those range of available libraries is expanding every day.

Sometimes, when building something new, it doesn't hurt to
build it all so that everything can work together as an
integrated whole. We need a wide variety of new libraries
that don't exist yet within the Rust ecosystem. This is an
opportunity to build some really nice libraries and look
at new ways to have them work together.
