# User Interface Management System

The UIMS handles what we interact with the user interface. It handles
presenting it on screen as well as accepting user input.

The UIMS exists in 3 pieces:

* Display server.
* Application representation.
* A data model and the protocol used to communicate between the
  display server and applications.

By defining things in terms of a protocol and a data model, we leave
open how the display server is implemented as well as opening up the
applications to being able to use the UIMS from a variety of languages.

The goal is to have a way to create modern user interfaces in a
cross-platform manner to build powerful tools.

## Display server

The display server will communicate via messages with an application
and display the resulting widgets and windows as well as process input
and send it to the application.

## Data Model and Protocol

Each widget type is defined in terms of what properties it has and what
events it interacts with.

The entire user interface for an application can be treated as a graph
with a root for each window / display along with some other objects that
get shared, such as styles. Changes in the user interface by the
application result in events being sent to the display server. The
display server processes input and sends events to the application. In
the initial version, all interactions between the application and the
display server must be asynchronous and non-blocking.

We will favor composition over inheritance in the design of the data
structures and their representations.

By using a clearly defined protocol, testing a user interface for
an application should be fairly straightforward as the tests can
work to ensure that the correct messages are sent rather than
trying to deal with what is happening on screen.

### Initial Widgets

The initial list of widgets should be drawn from what some common
toolkits support, probably starting from Ant Design, a mobile toolkit,
and Imgui or similar. This will give us a good start on covering the
basics that people need on a regular basis.

* Box
* Buttons: Push, CheckBox, Radio, Toggle, MenuButton
* Listbox
* Tab control
* Tree control
* Text input (single line, text area, and password)
* ...

### Events

Application to Display:

* Add to graph: Generic means of creating new widgets or chunks of UI
  graph.
* Modify graph: Generic means of modifying widgets, UI, style
  and anything else stored within the UI graph.
* Remove from graph: Generic means of removing widgets and other things
  from the UI graph.

Display to application:

* Pointer events: Read up on W3C work here.
* Keyboard events
* Other device input

It may be useful for the display server to be able to request a graph
from the application. This could be useful for generically handling tree
controls that can be expanded, without having to send all of the data to
the display at once, which isn't possible for something like a file
tree. This would also be useful for autocomplete models and more.

### Protocol Notes

Apart from carrying events and responses back and forth, the protocol
should handle:

* Versioning
* Feature negotiation
* ???

## Initial Implementation

### Display Server

An initial implementation of this will be written using TypeScript. This
will work within Electron and the browser (assuming you connect it to
the event streams). We should simultaneously implement this in at least
one other way.

Tests can be written by replaying streams of events.

### Application Representation

An initial version of this will be written in Rust as a library. There
will likely be one written in TypeScript at the same time as well.

## Closing Notes

The end product here is not a re-creation of HTML and the associated
stack, even though some implementations may render through a web
browser. That said, we expect to use some of the work that has been done
with the web stack to help refine our concepts and make things more
approachable and readily understandable. An example of this is that we
can leverage some elements of style sheets, pointer events, flexbox
layout, and so on.
